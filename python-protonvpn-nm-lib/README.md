# python-protonvpn-nm-lib

## About

This library is required for the legacy protonvpn tools: `protonvpn-cli` and
`protonvpn-gui`. The new protonvpn application does not provide a CLI interface
and the community CLI project must be run as root at all times and provides
a worse login interface.

These packages were deleted from AUR as of 28 July 2024. `protonvpn-cli` can be
found in this repository. `protonvpn-gui` is replaced by the new app.

Dependency for:
- [protonvpn-cli](../protonvpn-cli)
- [protonvpn-gui (Git URL)](https://aur.archlinux.org/protonvpn-gui.git)

Alternative interfaces:
- [protonvpn-cli-community (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/protonvpn-cli-community)
- [proton-vpn-gtk-app (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/proton-vpn-gtk-app)
