# python-protonvpn-nm-lib

## About

This library is required for the legacy protonvpn tools: `protonvpn-cli` and
`protonvpn-gui`. The new protonvpn application does not provide a CLI interface
and the community CLI project must be run as root at all times and provides
a worse login interface.

Both of the packages have a deletion request and might be gone as well in the
near future.

Dependency for:
- [protonvpn-cli (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/protonvpn-cli)
- [protonvpn-gui (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/protonvpn-gui)

Alternative interfaces:
- [protonvpn-cli-community (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/protonvpn-cli-community)
- [proton-vpn-gtk-app (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/proton-vpn-gtk-app)
